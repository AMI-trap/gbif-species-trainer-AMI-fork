This folder contains some example lists that can be used as input for fetching species unique keys from GBIF Taxonomy database. It can be as extensive as example1.csv or as minimalistic as example2.csv. The only requirement is to have the `column name` of the scientific species names. For example, it will be **taxon** for `example1.csv` and **beetles_species_names** for `example2.csv`. The file along with the column name will go as input to script xxxxx.
